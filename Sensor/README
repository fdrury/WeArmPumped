Need to get analog input from nRF52-DK

Need to send info over ANT to smartwatch.

Might be eaiser to start with sending data to watch - then I can communicate more easily with board.

May be difficult before app is finished - use nRF apps/tools in meantime.

Using ANT burst - well supported from both ends (using advanced burst demo)
